                    <h4>Steven Cook</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Wind enthusiast, tippet collector and leader length obsessive. Steven knows only trout. His education was hindered by his lack of attention to anything that wasn't trout fishing.
                        If you can find him he's usually at the front; over the furthest headland, bay or peninsula, pulling a team of wets and whistling the theme to The Littlest Hobo.

                    <h4>Tom Grahame</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>After trying coarse fishing as a teenager and sea fishing on family holidays to North Wales, Tom discovered fly-fishing for wild brown trout through the persistence of a good friend. He can be found stumbling around the banks of Cumbrian waters or the remote lochs of Scotland.
                        A tall man, he's the designated pack mule and is capable of carrying campfire wood over great distances.

                    <h4>Jerry Slater</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>Jerry loves his wild places and he started fishing for trout as a boy, in the streams of mid Wales, and the hill lochs on the west coast of Scotland. These days he tends to be knee deep in small Pennine rivers, or fishing the Llyns and tarns of North Wales and the Lake District. The experience is more important than the size of the fish, and wild is beautiful.</p>
