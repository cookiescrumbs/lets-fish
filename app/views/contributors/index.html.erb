                            <p>
                                Wind enthusiast, tippet collector and leader length obsessive. Steven knows only trout.
                                His education was hindered by his lack of attention to anything that wasn't trout
                                fishing.
                                If you can find him he's usually at the front; over the furthest headland, bay or
                                peninsula, pulling a team of wets and whistling the theme to The Littlest Hobo.

                            <br />
                            <p>After trying coarse fishing as a teenager and sea fishing on family holidays to North
                                Wales, Tom discovered fly-fishing for wild brown trout through the persistence of a good
                                friend. He can be found stumbling around the banks of Cumbrian waters or the remote
                                lochs of Scotland.
                                A tall man, he's the designated pack mule and is capable of carrying campfire wood over
                                great distances.

                        <br />
                        <p>Jerry loves his wild places and he started fishing for trout as a boy, in the streams of mid
                            Wales, and the hill lochs on the west coast of Scotland. These days he tends to be knee deep
                            in small Pennine rivers, or fishing the Llyns and tarns of North Wales and the Lake
                            District. The experience is more important than the size of the fish, and wild is beautiful.
