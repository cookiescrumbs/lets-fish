These days he tends to be knee deep in small Pennine rivers, or fishing the Llyns and tarns of North Wales and the Lake District. The experience is more important than the size of the fish, and wild is beautiful.'

He can be found stumbling around the banks of Cumbrian waters or the remote lochs of Scotland. A tall man, he\'s the designated pack mule and is capable of carrying campfire wood over great distances.'

If you can find him he\'s usually at the front; over the furthest headland, bay or peninsula, pulling a team of wets and whistling the theme to The Littlest Hobo.'
